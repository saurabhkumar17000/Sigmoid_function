# Sigmoid_function

a modular approximation methodology for efficient fixed-point hardware implementation of the sigmoid function. Our design consists of three modules:
piecewise linear (PWL) approximation as the initial solution, Taylor series approximation of the exponential function, and Newtonâ€“Raphson 
method-based approximation as the final solution.
